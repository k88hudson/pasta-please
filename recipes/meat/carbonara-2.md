#Spaghetti Carbonara
##Author: Duc Vu


##Ingredients
3 large free-range egg yolks
40g Parmesan cheese, plus extra to serve
sea salt
freshly ground black pepper
1x150g piece of higher-welfare pancetta
200g spaghetti
1 clove of garlic, peeled
extra virgin olive oil

##Instructions
Put the egg yolks into a bowl, finely grate in the Parmesan, season with pepper, 
then mix well with a fork and put to one side. Cut any hard skin off the pancetta 
and set aside, then chop the meat.

Cook the spaghetti in a large pan of boiling salted water until al dente. 
Meanwhile, rub the pancetta skin, if you have any, all over the base of a medium 
frying pan (this will add fantastic flavour, or use 1 tablespoon of oil instead), 
then place over a medium-high heat. Crush the garlic clove with the palm of your hand, 
add it to the pan and leave it to flavour the fat for a minute. Stir in the pancetta, 
then cook for 4 minutes, or until it starts to crisp up.

Pick out and discard the garlic from the pan, then, reserving some of the cooking water, 
drain and add the spaghetti. Toss well over the heat so it really soaks up all that lovely 
flavour, then remove the pan from the heat. Add a splash of the cooking water and toss well, 
season with pepper, then pour in the egg mixture – the pan will help to cook the egg gently, 
rather than scrambling it. Toss well, adding more cooking water until it’s lovely and glossy. 
Serve with a grating of Parmesan and an extra twist of pepper.

Tip: Use ready-sliced quality pancetta if you can’t buy it in one piece. It’s traditional to use 
spaghetti in this recipe, but bucatini or rigatoni are just as good.
